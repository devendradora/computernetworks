Open source is that where one can explore many 
new things , view, share, redistribute source code
of any open source project which may be free or charged.
The open source project which is free is FOSS .
Most of the open source organizations have a lot to help
a newbie to contribute to their Software. Almost all the 
organizations have something to file a bug, try to
list them in easy to hard order. Many organizations have 
specific helps for newbies. For ex: Mozilla has What can I do 
for Mozilla, GNOME has GnomeLove, Linux Kernel has 
Linux Kernel    Newbies,  all for newbies.
